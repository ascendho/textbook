title: Associative Containers
description: Associative containers organize their elements in terms of unique keys.
---

Associative containers are collections that organize their elements in terms of unique keys. Conceptually, these resemble Python dictionaries and sets. Use `map` and `unordered_map` anytime you need to map from a unique key to a value, or `set` and `unordered_set` to store a collection of unique elements.

## Ordered Containers

Ordered containers, `map` and `set`, impose an ordering constraint on their element types, allowing them to achieve key lookups in logarithmic time.

### Requirements

To use an `std::map<K, V>` or a `std::set<T>`, `K` or `T` must have an `operator<`. For example,

```cpp
std::map<std::string, int> frequencies; 
```

would be valid because it is valid to compare two `std::string` using the `<` operator whereas:

```cpp
std::set<std::ifstream> streams;
```

would not be because there is no `operator<` defined for `std::ifstream`. If a type `MyType` lacks an `operator<`, you can still use it with a `map` or `set` as long as you can define one, which can be done in a number of ways:

1. **Define an `operator<`**. For example, one could write a <abbr title="A free-floating function defined outside of a class">non-member function</abbr> `operator<`, shown below. See the chapter on operator overloading for more details on how to overload the `operator<` function.

    ```cpp
    bool operator<(const MyType& a, const MyType& b) {
        // Return true if `a` is less than `b`
    }
    ```

2. **Define a <abbr title="An object that acts like a function by overloading the call operator, e.g. `operator()`">functor</abbr>**. This technique is recommended if you don't want to overload the global `operator<` for `MyType`. For example:

    ```cpp
    struct Less {
        bool operator()(const MyType& a, const MyType& b) {
            // Return true if `a` is less than `b`
        }
    }

    std::map<MyType, double, Less> my_map;
    std::set<MyType, Less> my_set; 
    ```

    This works by explicitly passing a comparison template argument to `map` and `set`, which if not provided as a template argument defaults to [`std::less<T>`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/less), a built-in functor in the standard library that compares keys using `operator<`!

3. **Use a lambda function.** Similar to the above, this is useful if you don't want to override the global `operator<`, and also avoids creating a new functor type. Functionally, it is the same as **2**:

    ```cpp
    auto comp = [](const MyType& a, const MyType& b){ 
        // Return true if `a` is less than `b`
    };

    std::map<MyType, double, decltype(comp)> my_map(comp);
    std::set<MyType, decltype(comp)> my_set(comp);
    ```

    `decltype(comp)` infers the compile-time type of the lambda function `comp`, which is ordinarily hidden through the use of `auto`. Note that we also pass the lambda function to the constructor of `map` and `set`.

### `std::map<K, V>`

A `map` is the standard way to associate a key with a value in C++. It works exactly like a Python dictionary or a JavaScript object, with a few exceptions noted below.

#### Common operations

| Expression | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| `std::map<K, V> m` | Creates an empty map. See [above](#requirements) for initializing a map with a custom comparison function |
| `std::map<K, V> m { { k1, v1 }, /* ... */ }` | Uniform initializes a map with key-value pairs `{k1, v1}`, `{k2, v2}`, etc. |
| `auto v = m[k]` | Gets the value for a key `k`. **If `k` is not in the map, it will be inserted with the default value for `V` |
| `m[k] = v` | Sets or updates the value for a key `k` |
| `auto v = m.at(k)` | Gets the value for a key `k`. Will throw an error if `k` is not present in the map |
| `m.insert({ k, v })` <br /> `m.insert(p)` | Inserts an `std::pair p` (or the equivalent uniformly initialized pair using `k` and `v`) representing a key-value pair into the map **if it doesn't already exist** |
| `m.erase(k)` | Removes the key `k` from the map. `k` does not need to be present in the map |
| `if (m.count(k)) ...` <br /> `if (m.contains(k)) ...` <sub>**(since C++20)**</sub> | Checks if `k` is in the map |
| `m.empty()` | Checks if `m` is empty |

> Pay special attention to the fact that `m[k]` will **insert a default initialized value into `m` if `k` does not exist!** The default value corresponds to the parameterless constructor of `V`. For example, `false` for `bool`, `0` for `int`, `size_t`, `float`, and `double`, and an empty container for most container types. This can lead to strange behaviour, such as keys appearing in a map even if all you did was try to read a value. For example, the following snippet:
> 
> ```cpp
> std::map<std::string, std::vector<int>> m;
> auto v = m["Bjarne"];
> std::cout << m.size() << std::endl;
> ```
>
> prints `1` even though this code appears to only read the value of `"Bjarne"` from the map. The reason for this behaviour is that it makes certain algorithms trivial to implement. For example, consider the following code which counts characters in a string:
>
> ```cpp
> std::string quote = "Peace if possible, truth at all costs";
> std::map<char, size_t> counts;
> for (char c : quote) {
>   counts[c]++; 
> }
> ```
>
> Compare this to the equivalent Python code, which might need to check for the existence of each character in the map before attempting to increment its count:
>
> ```python
> quote = "Peace if possible, truth at all costs"
> counts = {}
> for c in quote:
>   if c not in counts:
>     counts[c] = 0
>   counts[c] += 1
> ```
>
> In C++, the default-initialization of the value obviates this check!

### `std::set<T>`

A `set` is the standard way of storing a collection of unique elements in C++. No matter how many times you add the same element to a `set`, it's as if you only added it once.

#### Common operations

| Expression | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| `std::set<T>` s | Creates an empty set |
| `s.insert(e)` | Adds `e` to `s`. Calling `insert(e)` more than once has the same effect as calling it once |
| `s.erase(e)` | Removes `e` from `s`. `e` does not need to be `s` |
| `if (s.count(e)) ...` <br /> `if (s.contains(e)) ...` <sub>**(since C++20)**</sub> | Checks if `e` is in the set |
| `s.empty()` | Checks if `s` is empty |

### Behind the scenes

You may be wondering: why do `std::map<K, V>` and `std::set<T>` impose the requirement that `K` and `T` have a `operator<`? The reason has to do with how these data structures are implemented behind the scenes. The ability to compare two elements allows us to build an efficient data structure that can quickly determine whether a key or value exists in a `map` or `set`.

The C++ standard does not enforce any particular implementation for the `map` and `set`, but compilers almost always implement these data structures with a [red-black tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree), allowing for efficient traversal during key lookup. Let's see how this works for a `map` (`set` will behave similarly). Consider the following code snippet:

```cpp
std::map<std::string, size_t> m {
  { "Ludwig", 722 },
  { "Amadeus", 626 },
  { "Johann", 1128 },
  { "Gustav", 64 },
  { "Dmitri", 147 }
}; `[]`

auto gustav = m["Gustav"];
```

```memory
L1 {

  #label subtitle "The map organizes its elements in memory as a [binary search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree). Each `TreeNode` has a `std::pair` containing the key and value for the node, and `left` and `right` pointers to the next node in the sequence. The tree is laid out in such a way as to make finding the node associated with a given key fast, as shown on the next line."

  m = "map<string, size_t>" { size: 5, root: &root }
  root => TreeNode { value: { first: Johann, second: 1128 }, left: &l, right: &r }

  l ==> TreeNode { value: { first: Dmitri, second: 147 }, left: &ll, right: &lr }
  r ==> TreeNode { value: { first: Ludwig, second: 722 }, left: null, right: null }

  ll ===> TreeNode { value: { first: Amadeus, second: 626 }, left: null, right: null }
  lr ===> TreeNode { value: { first: Gustav, second: 64 }, left: null, right: null }
}

L2 {

  #label subtitle "To find the value associated with a given key, the `map` traverses its tree using a binary search algorithm. Starting with the root node, it compares the desired key using the provided comparison function (`operator<` by default) to see which direction traversal should continue:
  
    - `\"Gustav\" < \"Johann\"`, so we go **left**
    - `\"Gustav\" >= \"Dmitri\"`, so we go **right**
    - `\"Gustav\"` is not less than itself, so we have found the node we were looking for!

  This is a simple example with five mappings, but imagine a tree with hundreds or thousands of mappings. Assuming our tree is well-balanced, each comparison we make would eliminates have of the nodes from consideration. 
  
  As you might expect, there is something special about the tree that allows this algorithm to work. Namely, all the keys in left subtree of a parent are less than the parent's key, and all of the keys in the right subtree are greater than the parent's key (this is what a binary search tree is). A `map` will perform better if its tree is roughly balancedâ€”this is exactly what a [red black tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-black_tree) (a specific kind of binary search tree) aims to accomplish.
  "

  m = "map<string, size_t>" { size: 5, root: &root }
  gustav = 64
  root => TreeNode { value: { first: Johann, second: 1128 }, left: &l, right: &r }

  l ==> TreeNode { value: { first: Dmitri, second: 147 }, left: &ll, right: &lr }
  r ==> TreeNode { value: { first: Ludwig, second: 722 }, left: null, right: null }

  ll ===> TreeNode { value: { first: Amadeus, second: 626 }, left: null, right: null }
  lr ===> TreeNode { value: { first: Gustav, second: 64 }, left: null, right: null }

  #style:link { dash: { animation: true } } m.root root.left l.right
  #style:link { opacity: 0.5 } root.right l.left
  #style { opacity: 0.5 } r ll
  #style:row highlight lr.value.second
}
```

A `set` uses the same red-black tree data structure under the hood to determine quickly determine if an element exists inside a set. `set` has no concept of a key-value pair, so its `TreeNode` behind the scenes is somewhat simpler: rather than storing a `pair` of key and value, it directly stores the set element in the node. Otherwise, `set` and `map` work exactly the same: conceptually, you can think of a `set` being somewhat like a `map` without any values.

## Unordered Containers

Unordered containers, `unordered_map` and `unordered_set`, perhaps more commonly known in other langauges as "hash tables", make use of hash and equality functions to achieve near constant-time key lookups.

### Requirements

To use `std::unordered_map<K, V>` or `std::unordered_set<T>`, `K` or `T` must have an associated hash function and key-equality function.

#### Hash function

A hash function "randomly" scrambles up an element of type `K` into a value of type `size_t`. When formally defined, hash functions are deterministicâ€”the same `K` will always produce the same `size_t`â€”but they are discontinuousâ€”small changes in the input `K` will produce large, unpredictable changes in the output `size_t`. These properties are key to how unordered data structures accelerate their element lookups.

Many types, e.g. `int`, `double`, `std::string`, have built-in hash functions (you can see the full list [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/hash)). Other seemingly basic types, such as `std::pair` and `std::tuple`, do not. To add a hash function to an unsupported type, do one of the following:

1. **Specialize the `std::hash` functor.** This is the most common way to add a hash function to a type. It involves creating a <abbr title="">template specialization</abbr> for the `std::hash<T>` functor, which is the default strategy unordered containers use to hash their elements. The syntax is as follows:

    ```cpp
    template<>
    struct std::hash<MyType>
    {
      std::size_t operator()(const MyType& o) const noexcept
      {
        // Calculate and return the hash of `o`...
      }
    };

    std::unordered_map<MyType, std::string> my_map;
    ```

2. **Define a custom functor.** This is an alternative to the above syntax if you do not want to change the default hash function for all users of a type. For example:

    ```cpp
    struct MyHash {
      std::size_t operator()(const MyType& o) const noexcept
      {
        // Calculate and return the hash of `o`...
      }
    };

    std::unordered_map<MyType, std::string, MyHash> my_map;
    ```

3. **Use a lambda function.** Similar to the above, this is useful if you don't want to override the global `operator<`, and also avoids creating a new functor type. Functionally, it is the same as **2**:

    ```cpp
    int main() {
    ---
    auto hash = [](const MyType& o) {
      // Calculate and return the hash of `o`...
    };

    /* The first number (10) is the starting number of buckets!
     * See the behind the scenes section for more information about buckets. */
    std::unordered_map<MyType, std::string, decltype(hash)> my_map(10, hash);
    std::unordered_set<MyType, decltype(hash)> my_set(10, hash);
    ---
    }
    ```

When writing your own hash functions, make sure that the output `size_t` are well distributedâ€”as we will see, the performance of the container you use depends on how "random" its hash function outputs are. It is worthwhile reading [this Wikiedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function#Hashing_integer_data_types) for more information on how to design a good hash function. A good way to combine hash values, for example, is to utilize bit-shift, XOR, and multiplication by prime numbers, as the following example of a hash function for an `std::vector<T>` demonstrates. Preferrably, use a third-party library like [`boost::hash_combine`](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_43_0/doc/html/hash/combine.html) to combine hash values in a way that yields a good distribution over the integers.

```cpp
template <typename T>
struct std::hash<std::vector<T>> {
  std::size_t operator()(const std::vector<T>& vec) const {
    std::size_t seed = vec.size();
    for (const auto& elem : vec) {
      size_t h = element_hash(elem);
      h = ((h >> 16) ^ h) * 0x45d9f3b;
      h = ((h >> 16) ^ h) * 0x45d9f3b;
      h = (h >> 16) ^ h;
      seed ^= h + 0x9e3779b9 + (seed << 6) + (seed >> 2);
    }
    return seed;
  }

  std::hash<T> element_hash{};
};
```
