# Introduction

Welcome to the **Stanford CS106L textbook**! The goal of this textbook is to familiarize you with the fundamentals of the C++ language as well as the primary components of the Standard Template Library (STL). This resource is organized with inspiration from Stanford's CS106L: Standard C++ Programming course. However, this book can be used without reference to any of CS106L's course materials, although completing the assignments may reinforce topics the material covered in this textbook.

## Who You Are

You've had some exposure to introductory computer science concepts, like variables, expressions, conditional statements, etc. either through self-learning or through a CS1/introduction to programming course. We're hoping that this textbook is accessible to any motivated learner!

## Inspiration

This textbook is in part inspired by the Brown Computer Science Department and their work on the [rust-book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/).
